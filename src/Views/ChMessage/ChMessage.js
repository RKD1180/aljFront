          A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning
          spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under
          the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal
          education, which is sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems,
          students progress through a series of schools. The names for these
          schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section
          below) but generally include primary school for young children and
          secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education.
          An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a
          university college or university.
